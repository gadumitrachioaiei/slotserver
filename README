This is an implementation of atkins-diet slot machine:

The purpose of this code is to understand the game and the implementation. There are very few tests. There are improvements that can be made performance wise.

Just run the server and try requests, e.g.:
```curl -v -X POST --data '{"uid": "xyz", "chips": 1000, "bet":100}' "http://localhost:8080/api/machines/atkins-diet/spins"```
Example response:
```{
    "Spins": [
        {
            "Type": "main",
            "Stops": [
                [11,23,14,16,30],
                [12,24,15,17,31],
                [13,25,16,18,0]
            ],
            "Win": 100,
            "PayLines": [
                [1,2,2,2,1],
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Win": 100,
    "Chips": 1000,
    "Bet": 100,
    "JWT": {
        "UID": "xyz",
        "Chips": 1000,
        "Bet": 100
    }
}
```
All indexes start with 0. "Stops" represents the result grid, "PayLines" represents the winning pay lines and "Type" can be main or free. There is only a main spin, and all others are free, returned in the spinning order. To find more about the result you can run TestMachineManual or TestMachineWithSpin and print the result of the Result.debug method.
Example:
```
go test -v github.com/gadumitrachioaiei/slotserver/slot -run TestMachineManual

Short description of the rules:
1. A pay line wins if it contains a pay table entry ( scatter pay table is handled separated ), matched starting with first symbol.
Wild symbol can be replaced with any symbol.
If a pay line contains several pay table entries, than the one with biggest prize wins.
If there are several pay table entries the shortest one wins.
2. For the scatter symbols to give you a win, they can be found anywhere in the grid.
Besides the prize found in the scatter pay table, at least 3 scatter symbols will also give you 10 free spins with triple the normal win.
A free spin can also give you more free spins, unlimited.
3. All pay lines that contain a pay table entry win.
3. All prizes are multiplied by wager / number of pay lines.
