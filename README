The purpose of this code is to understand the game and the implementation. There are very few tests. There are improvements that can be made performance wise.

Just run the server and try requests, e.g.:
```curl -v -X POST --data '{"uid": "xyz", "chips": 1000, "bet":100}' "http://localhost:8080/api/machines/atkins-diet/spins"```
